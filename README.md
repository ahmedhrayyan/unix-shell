# Unix shell
This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface
that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate
process.

The project is the first project of chapter 3 from Operating systems concepts book.

## Project requirements
- [x] Executing commands in a separate process
- [ ] Creating a history feature (didn't think it worth it)
